const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added."


const design = 'During the design stage of the development cycle, designers and developers will determine how the front and back end of the software will look and function, and they will also decide how it will be built.'

const implementaion = 'Next the Implementaion Stage. This is the stage where developers begin coding and setting up the infrastructure for the system.'


const testingAndIntegration = `the testers make sure that all documentation requirements were met, users can perform tasks as expected, and incorrect user actions won't cause the system to break.`

const analysisOfRequiremnts = `Make sure all the requirements were met and everything is designed the way the clients asked. This may also mean walking over everything step by step and making sure that all parts were handled.`

const maintain = 'Maintaining the software and making sure no errors occur. This may also mean updating to any recent changes or just keeping up to date with everything. '
